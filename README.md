# Meta-analysis visualisations

The first version of these scripts perform visualisations of summary effect size forest plots. This is a useful tool for summarising a series of meta-analyses in a single paper or a set of meta-analyses from different articles, which address the same research question. 

Future versions will visualise conventional meta-analysis forest plots.
