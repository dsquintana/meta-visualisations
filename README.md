# Meta-analysis visualisations

![example_plot](https://github.com/dsquintana/meta-visualisations/blob/master/example_plot.png)

The first version of these scripts perform visualisations of summary effect size forest plots. This is a useful tool for summarising a series of meta-analyses in a single paper or a set of meta-analyses from different articles, which address the same research question. 

Future versions will visualise conventional meta-analysis forest plots.

See [this blog post](https://www.dsquintana.blog/equivalence-enhanced-forest-plots-with-power-tiles/) for an explination and guide.
